to start server i use: netlify dev --port 3030
site address is: https://blades-org.netlify.app/
A discord account is needed to login since i used the discord Oauth2
the ship page works just takes some time to load from the api. it shows the first ten pulls. i plan on making an option to pull more info. images took way to long for now
